Who would have thought that my first blog would be one I had to write for school? Totally not your typical blog writer but here it goes!

First of all, enrolling in this course has taken me out of my normal comfort zone and for a good reason!  I work in the hospitality service industry and for a long time I have been wanting to get out of this kind of work. It just wasn't cutting it anymore for me, I was bored and knew I could do so much more!  I've always been into building computers and messing around with technology, it's what I have enjoyed doing and ever since I was a young girl.  I became interested in software engineering because I have always been a problem solver and I was curious to find out how programs worked behind the scenes.

I'm hoping to really gain the skills to possibly get into game or app development, there are also so many tech businesses around Denver that I can take advantage of!  One of the reasons that really shed some light on why I chose this path was the potential to take this skill and implement it to helping a friend with the start of owning his own drone business.  Creating drone light shows with the intent of also creating a search and rescue drone program.  He'll need some help once things pick up and I'm excited to be a part of his development.  Other than that, I'm excited for what lies ahead and to be able to get into a career that I will actually enjoy!
